/**
 * {@link TaskExecutor}扩展实现异步的接口，
 * 提供带有启动超时参数的重载{@link #execute(Runnable, long)}
 * 变体以及对{@link java.util.concurrent.Callable}的支持。
 *
 * <p>注意：{@link java.util.concurrent.Executors}类包含一组方法，
 * 可以在执行它们之前将一些其它类似于闭包的常见对象转换为{@link Callable}，
 * 例如{@link java.security.PrivilegedAction}。
 *
 * <p>实现此接口还表示{@link #execute(Runnable)}方法不会在调用者的线程中执行其Runnable，
 * 而是在其它线程中异步执行。
